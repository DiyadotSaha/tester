Drug,Inhibitor,Dose,Side Effects,Monitoring
Imatinib,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,10 mg/kg once a day. ,"Grade 1 GI signs and leukopenia. Imatinib is known to induce hepatotoxicity in a proportion of dogs; this hepatotoxicity appears to be idiosyncratic in nature, resulting in elevations in ALT and ALP that necessitate discontinuation of therapy. ","Monthly CBC, chemistry panels based on clinical response or adverse events."
Dasatinib,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,0.5 mg/kg - 0.75 mg/kg once daily or every other day. ,"GI upset, anorexia, and diarrhea; if noted, back down to the last tolerated dose or try every other day dosing. Side effects pass quickly once the drug is stopped. ","Monthly CBC, chemistry panels based on clinical response or adverse events."
Palbociclib,Cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor,0.2 mg/kg once daily. ,Has been associated with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. ,"Monthly CBC, chemistry panels based on clinical response or adverse events."
Olaparib,Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor,2.5 – 3.0 mg/kg once to twice daily. ,Can be associated with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. ,"Monthly CBC, chemistry panels based on clinical response or adverse events"
Ibrutinib,Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor,2.5 - 5.0 mg/kg once daily. Doses of up to 20 mg/kg have been administered. ,Well tolerated in a canine lymphoma study. ,"Monthly CBC, chemistry panels based on clinical response or adverse events."
Lapatinib,Dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor (HER2/neu and EGFR),20 - 30 mg/kg once daily. ,"Lapatinib+piroxicam: most grade 1 or 2, transient, no treatment discontinuation, dose-reduction in 9%; overall incidence of increase ALT and ALP were significantly higher in this group compared to piroxicam alone; dermatologic adverse events (hyperpigmentation, pruritus, skin ulceration, and alopecia) were noted in 11% of cases (intervention not required in most cases). ","Monthly CBC, chemistry panels based on clinical response or adverse events."
Sirolimus,mTOR kinase inhibitor,0.1 mg/kg once daily. ,Can be associated with anorexia and fever.  ,"Monthly CBC, chemistry panels based on clinical response or adverse events"
Sorafenib,Multi kinase inhibitor ,3 – 10 mg/kg once daily. ,"Cutaneous toxicity (grade 2 alopecia, grade 1 hyperpigmentation, grade 1 localized erythema and alopecia) and diarrhea (grade 1). Hyperbilirubinemia and serum transaminase elevations did not occur. ","Monthly CBC, chemistry panels based on clinical response or adverse events."
Trametinib,MEK inhibitor,0.5 mg/m2 or 0.015 – 0.020 mg/kg once daily ,"Lethargy, gastrointestinal toxicity, liver enzyme elevation, anemia, systemic hypertension and proteinuria have been reported. Dose-limiting toxicities included systemic hypertension, proteinuria, lethargy and elevated ALP, and were all Grade 3. The drug exposures increased more than linearly with dose since the elimination of trametinib was saturable. At a dose of 500 μg Q24h (0.5 mg/m2/day in a 30 kg dog), approximately 70% of dogs had an average steady-state concentration of 10 ng/mL, achieved after approximately 2 weeks. This threshold was associated with clinical efficacy in humans. Target engagement was not observed in biospecimens collected on Days 0 and 7. In conclusion, trametinib was considered safe in dogs with cancer, and the dose of 0.5 mg/m2/day was the recommended dose for phase II studies.","Monthly CBC, chemistry panels and urinalysis based on clinical response or adverse events. Clinical trials Cornell (SCC melanoma) and MSU and CSU (histiocytic sarcoma)"
Vorinostat,Inhibitor of histone deacetylases (HDAC).,15 – 30 mg/kg every other day. ,Nausea. ,"Monthly CBC, chemistry panels based on clinical response or adverse events."
Vemurafenib,BRAF inhibitor,37.5 mg/kg twice daily. ,Anorexia. ,"Monthly CBC, chemistry panels based on clinical response or adverse events."
